# fox

[fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org) is an excellent X window manager.
It is stable, can be elegantly configurated, works well with applications,
and is well maintained (although some docs seem out of date).
`Fox` is a set of configurations for `fluxbox`, and is designed to work with `xfce4-desktop`.

## To use `fox`, please
1. backup your previous `fluxbox` configurations in `~/.fluxbox/`, and
1. clone `fox`  `git clone https://github.com/UBTC/fox ~/.fluxbox`

That is all. Have fun!
